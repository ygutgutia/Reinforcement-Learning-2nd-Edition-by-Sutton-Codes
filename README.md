# Some Codes to work alongside Reinforcement Learning - An Introduction by Richard Sutton and Andrew G. Barto[Link](https://www.amazon.co.jp/exec/obidos/ASIN/0262039249/hatena-blog-22/)

### Motivation
Detailed Solutions for each chapter an be found at [Link](https://github.com/LyWangPX/Reinforcement-Learning-2nd-Edition-by-Sutton-Exercise-Solutions) - an excellent solution guide to help self-learners.

The aim of this repository is to collate some working codes hich shall be helpful in visualising the text.
Some codes are written by me, others might be obtained from the internet, the source of which shall be referenced at the top of each code.

### About Mistakes
This is a personal proect done while self-learning. Although the working state of each code is verified by me before updating the repository, some of these might have theoretical/conceptual/semantic errors, which I would be glad to correct when pointed out in issues.

Also incase someone wants to contribute additional code(or better code) are welcome to do so by raising a PR.
